Psa103:1 Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name.
Psa103:2 Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:
Psa103:3 Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases;
Psa103:4 Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;
Psa103:5 Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's.
Psa103:6 The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed.
Psa103:7 He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel.
Psa103:8 The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy.
Psa103:9 He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for ever.
Psa103:10 He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.
Psa103:11 For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him.
Psa103:12 As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us.
Psa103:13 Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear him.
Psa103:14 For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.
Psa103:15 As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.
Psa103:16 For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more.
Psa103:17 But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's children;
Psa103:18 To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them.
Psa103:19 The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all.
Psa103:20 Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.
Psa103:21 Bless ye the LORD, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure.
Psa103:22 Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion: bless the LORD, O my soul.
