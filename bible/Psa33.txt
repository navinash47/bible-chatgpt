Psa33:1 Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous: for praise is comely for the upright.
Psa33:2 Praise the LORD with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings.
Psa33:3 Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise.
Psa33:4 For the word of the LORD is right; and all his works are done in truth.
Psa33:5 He loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the goodness of the LORD.
Psa33:6 By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.
Psa33:7 He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he layeth up the depth in storehouses.
Psa33:8 Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.
Psa33:9 For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast.
Psa33:10 The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he maketh the devices of the people of none effect.
Psa33:11 The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations.
Psa33:12 Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD; and the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance.
Psa33:13 The LORD looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men.
Psa33:14 From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth.
Psa33:15 He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their works.
Psa33:16 There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty man is not delivered by much strength.
Psa33:17 An horse is a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver any by his great strength.
Psa33:18 Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy;
Psa33:19 To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine.
Psa33:20 Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he is our help and our shield.
Psa33:21 For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy name.
Psa33:22 Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in thee.
