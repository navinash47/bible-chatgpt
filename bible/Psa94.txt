Psa94:1 O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom vengeance belongeth, shew thyself.
Psa94:2 Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render a reward to the proud.
Psa94:3 LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph?
Psa94:4 How long shall they utter and speak hard things? and all the workers of iniquity boast themselves?
Psa94:5 They break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thine heritage.
Psa94:6 They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless.
Psa94:7 Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard it.
Psa94:8 Understand, ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when will ye be wise?
Psa94:9 He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see?
Psa94:10 He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he that teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know?
Psa94:11 The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity.
Psa94:12 Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, and teachest him out of thy law;
Psa94:13 That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be digged for the wicked.
Psa94:14 For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance.
Psa94:15 But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the upright in heart shall follow it.
Psa94:16 Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?
Psa94:17 Unless the LORD had been my help, my soul had almost dwelt in silence.
Psa94:18 When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up.
Psa94:19 In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul.
Psa94:20 Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which frameth mischief by a law?
Psa94:21 They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood.
Psa94:22 But the LORD is my defence; and my God is the rock of my refuge.
Psa94:23 And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own wickedness; yea, the LORD our God shall cut them off.
