Psa148:2 Praise ye him, all his angels: praise ye him, all his hosts.

Psa148:5 Let them praise the name of the LORD: for he commanded, and they were created.
Psa148:6 He hath also stablished them for ever and ever: he hath made a decree which shall not pass.
Psa148:7 Praise the LORD from the earth, ye dragons, and all deeps:
Psa148:8 Fire, and hail; snow, and vapours; stormy wind fulfilling his word:
Psa148:9 Mountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars:
Psa148:10 Beasts, and all cattle; creeping things, and flying fowl:
Psa148:11 Kings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of the earth:
Psa148:12 Both young men, and maidens; old men, and children:
Psa148:13 Let them praise the name of the LORD: for his name alone is excellent; his glory is above the earth and heaven.
Psa148:14 He also exalteth the horn of his people, the praise of all his saints; even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him. Praise ye the LORD.
