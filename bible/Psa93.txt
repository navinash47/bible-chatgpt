Psa93:1 The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself: the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved.
Psa93:2 Thy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting.
Psa93:3 The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves.
Psa93:4 The LORD on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yea, than the mighty waves of the sea.
Psa93:5 Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house, O LORD, for ever.
