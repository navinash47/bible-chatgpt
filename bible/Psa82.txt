Psa82:2 How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Selah.
Psa82:3 Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy.
Psa82:4 Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the wicked.
Psa82:5 They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course.
Psa82:6 I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High.
Psa82:7 But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.
Psa82:8 Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations.
