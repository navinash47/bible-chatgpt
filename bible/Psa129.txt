Psa129:1 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now say:
Psa129:2 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they have not prevailed against me.
Psa129:3 The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows.
Psa129:4 The LORD is righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked.
Psa129:5 Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion.
Psa129:6 Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth afore it groweth up:
Psa129:7 Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom.
Psa129:8 Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD be upon you: we bless you in the name of the LORD.
