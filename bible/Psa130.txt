Psa130:1 Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O LORD.
Psa130:2 Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications.
Psa130:3 If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?
Psa130:4 But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared.
Psa130:5 I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope.
Psa130:6 My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning.
Psa130:7 Let Israel hope in the LORD: for with the LORD there is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption.
Psa130:8 And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.
