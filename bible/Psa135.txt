Psa135:1 Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the name of the LORD; praise him, O ye servants of the LORD.
Psa135:2 Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God,
Psa135:3 Praise the LORD; for the LORD is good: sing praises unto his name; for it is pleasant.
Psa135:4 For the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself, and Israel for his peculiar treasure.
Psa135:5 For I know that the LORD is great, and that our Lord is above all gods.
Psa135:6 Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that did he in heaven, and in earth, in the seas, and all deep places.
Psa135:7 He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries.
Psa135:8 Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast.
Psa135:9 Who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.
Psa135:10 Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings;
Psa135:11 Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan:
Psa135:12 And gave their land for an heritage, an heritage unto Israel his people.
Psa135:13 Thy name, O LORD, endureth for ever; and thy memorial, O LORD, throughout all generations.
Psa135:14 For the LORD will judge his people, and he will repent himself concerning his servants.
Psa135:15 The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.
Psa135:16 They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not;
Psa135:17 They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath in their mouths.
Psa135:18 They that make them are like unto them: so is every one that trusteth in them.
Psa135:19 Bless the LORD, O house of Israel: bless the LORD, O house of Aaron:
Psa135:20 Bless the LORD, O house of Levi: ye that fear the LORD, bless the LORD.
Psa135:21 Blessed be the LORD out of Zion, which dwelleth at Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.
