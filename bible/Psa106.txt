Psa106:1 Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Psa106:2 Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? who can shew forth all his praise?
Psa106:3 Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth righteousness at all times.
Psa106:4 Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people: O visit me with thy salvation;
Psa106:5 That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.
Psa106:6 We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.
Psa106:7 Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even at the Red sea.
Psa106:8 Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.
Psa106:9 He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.
Psa106:10 And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
Psa106:11 And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.
Psa106:12 Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.
Psa106:13 They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:
Psa106:14 But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.
Psa106:15 And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.
Psa106:16 They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the LORD.
Psa106:17 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.
Psa106:18 And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.
Psa106:19 They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.
Psa106:20 Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.
Psa106:21 They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt;
Psa106:22 Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red sea.
Psa106:23 Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.
Psa106:24 Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:
Psa106:25 But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.
Psa106:26 Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:
Psa106:27 To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.
Psa106:28 They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.
Psa106:29 Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them.
Psa106:30 Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed.
Psa106:31 And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore.
Psa106:32 They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:
Psa106:33 Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.
Psa106:34 They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:
Psa106:35 But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.
Psa106:36 And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.
Psa106:37 Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,
Psa106:38 And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.
Psa106:39 Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.
Psa106:40 Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.
Psa106:41 And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.
Psa106:42 Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.
Psa106:43 Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.
Psa106:44 Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:
Psa106:45 And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.
Psa106:46 He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.
Psa106:47 Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise.
Psa106:48 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD.
