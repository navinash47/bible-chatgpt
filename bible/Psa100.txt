Psa100:1 Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all ye lands.
Psa100:2 Serve the LORD with gladness: come before his presence with singing.
Psa100:3 Know ye that the LORD he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
Psa100:4 Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name.
Psa100:5 For the LORD is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endureth to all generations.
