Job38:1 Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,
Job38:2 Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?
Job38:3 Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me.
Job38:4 Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding.
Job38:5 Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it?
Job38:6 Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof;
Job38:7 When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?
Job38:8 Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, as if it had issued out of the womb?
Job38:9 When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it,
Job38:10 And brake up for it my decreed place, and set bars and doors,
Job38:11 And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed?
Job38:12 Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; and caused the dayspring to know his place;
Job38:13 That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it?
Job38:14 It is turned as clay to the seal; and they stand as a garment.
Job38:15 And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arm shall be broken.
Job38:16 Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth?
Job38:17 Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death?
Job38:18 Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou knowest it all.
Job38:19 Where is the way where light dwelleth? and as for darkness, where is the place thereof,
Job38:20 That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof?
Job38:21 Knowest thou it, because thou wast then born? or because the number of thy days is great?
Job38:22 Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail,
Job38:23 Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?
Job38:24 By what way is the light parted, which scattereth the east wind upon the earth?
Job38:25 Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder;
Job38:26 To cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is; on the wilderness, wherein there is no man;
Job38:27 To satisfy the desolate and waste ground; and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth?
Job38:28 Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew?
Job38:29 Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?
Job38:30 The waters are hid as with a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen.
Job38:31 Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?
Job38:32 Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?
Job38:33 Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?
Job38:34 Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee?
Job38:35 Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go, and say unto thee, Here we are?
Job38:36 Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understanding to the heart?
Job38:37 Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the bottles of heaven,
Job38:38 When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast together?
Job38:39 Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of the young lions,
Job38:40 When they couch in their dens, and abide in the covert to lie in wait?
Job38:41 Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry unto God, they wander for lack of meat.
