Psa44:1 We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, what work thou didst in their days, in the times of old.
Psa44:2 How thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and plantedst them; how thou didst afflict the people, and cast them out.
Psa44:3 For they got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them.
Psa44:4 Thou art my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob.
Psa44:5 Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us.
Psa44:6 For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me.
Psa44:7 But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to shame that hated us.
Psa44:8 In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for ever. Selah.
Psa44:9 But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not forth with our armies.
Psa44:10 Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they which hate us spoil for themselves.
Psa44:11 Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat; and hast scattered us among the heathen.
Psa44:12 Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase thy wealth by their price.
Psa44:13 Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us.
Psa44:14 Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the head among the people.
Psa44:15 My confusion is continually before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me,
Psa44:16 For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and avenger.
Psa44:17 All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.
Psa44:18 Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way;
Psa44:19 Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death.
Psa44:20 If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god;
Psa44:21 Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart.
Psa44:22 Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.
Psa44:23 Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast us not off for ever.
Psa44:24 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our affliction and our oppression?
Psa44:25 For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth unto the earth.
Psa44:26 Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies' sake.
