Psa126:1 When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream.
Psa126:2 Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done great things for them.
Psa126:3 The LORD hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad.
Psa126:4 Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south.
Psa126:5 They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.
Psa126:6 He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.
