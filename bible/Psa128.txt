Psa128:1 Blessed is every one that feareth the LORD; that walketh in his ways.
Psa128:2 For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee.
Psa128:3 Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house: thy children like olive plants round about thy table.
Psa128:4 Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the LORD.
Psa128:5 The LORD shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.
Psa128:6 Yea, thou shalt see thy children's children, and peace upon Israel.
