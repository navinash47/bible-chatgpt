Psa91:1 He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.
Psa91:2 I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust.
Psa91:3 Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence.
Psa91:4 He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler.
Psa91:5 Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day;
Psa91:6 Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.
Psa91:7 A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.
Psa91:8 Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked.
Psa91:9 Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation;
Psa91:10 There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.
Psa91:11 For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.
Psa91:12 They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.
Psa91:13 Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.
Psa91:14 Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.
Psa91:15 He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.
Psa91:16 With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.
