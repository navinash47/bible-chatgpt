Psa124:1 If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, now may Israel say;
Psa124:2 If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, when men rose up against us:
Psa124:3 Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us:
Psa124:4 Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul:
Psa124:5 Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.
Psa124:6 Blessed be the LORD, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth.
Psa124:7 Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped.
Psa124:8 Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth.
