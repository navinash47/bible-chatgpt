Psa83:1 Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God.
Psa83:2 For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head.
Psa83:3 They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones.
Psa83:4 They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.
Psa83:5 For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee:
Psa83:6 The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes;
Psa83:7 Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre;
Psa83:8 Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot. Selah.
Psa83:9 Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook of Kison:
Psa83:10 Which perished at Endor: they became as dung for the earth.
Psa83:11 Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:
Psa83:12 Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession.
Psa83:13 O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind.
Psa83:14 As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire;
Psa83:15 So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm.
Psa83:16 Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD.
Psa83:17 Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish:
Psa83:18 That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over all the earth.
