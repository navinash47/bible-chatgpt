Job26:1 But Job answered and said,
Job26:2 How hast thou helped him that is without power? how savest thou the arm that hath no strength?
Job26:3 How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom? and how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is?
Job26:4 To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee?
Job26:5 Dead things are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof.
Job26:6 Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.
Job26:7 He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing.
Job26:8 He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them.
Job26:9 He holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud upon it.
Job26:10 He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end.
Job26:11 The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.
Job26:12 He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud.
Job26:13 By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent.
Job26:14 Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?
