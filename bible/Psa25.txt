Psa25:1 Unto thee, O LORD, do I lift up my soul.
Psa25:2 O my God, I trust in thee: let me not be ashamed, let not mine enemies triumph over me.
Psa25:3 Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed: let them be ashamed which transgress without cause.
Psa25:4 Shew me thy ways, O LORD; teach me thy paths.
Psa25:5 Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God of my salvation; on thee do I wait all the day.
Psa25:6 Remember, O LORD, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses; for they have been ever of old.
Psa25:7 Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions: according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness' sake, O LORD.
Psa25:8 Good and upright is the LORD: therefore will he teach sinners in the way.
Psa25:9 The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach his way.
Psa25:10 All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.
Psa25:11 For thy name's sake, O LORD, pardon mine iniquity; for it is great.
Psa25:12 What man is he that feareth the LORD? him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose.
Psa25:13 His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the earth.
Psa25:14 The secret of the LORD is with them that fear him; and he will shew them his covenant.
Psa25:15 Mine eyes are ever toward the LORD; for he shall pluck my feet out of the net.
Psa25:16 Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I am desolate and afflicted.
Psa25:17 The troubles of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of my distresses.
Psa25:18 Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my sins.
Psa25:19 Consider mine enemies; for they are many; and they hate me with cruel hatred.
Psa25:20 O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I put my trust in thee.
Psa25:21 Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee.
Psa25:22 Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.
