Psa115:1 Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake.
Psa115:2 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God?
Psa115:3 But our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased.
Psa115:4 Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.
Psa115:5 They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they see not:
Psa115:6 They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they smell not:
Psa115:7 They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they walk not: neither speak they through their throat.
Psa115:8 They that make them are like unto them; so is every one that trusteth in them.
Psa115:9 O Israel, trust thou in the LORD: he is their help and their shield.
Psa115:10 O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD: he is their help and their shield.
Psa115:11 Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD: he is their help and their shield.
Psa115:12 The LORD hath been mindful of us: he will bless us; he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron.
Psa115:13 He will bless them that fear the LORD, both small and great.
Psa115:14 The LORD shall increase you more and more, you and your children.
Psa115:15 Ye are blessed of the LORD which made heaven and earth.
Psa115:16 The heaven, even the heavens, are the LORD's: but the earth hath he given to the children of men.
Psa115:17 The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence.
Psa115:18 But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and for evermore. Praise the LORD.
