Psa49:1 Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world:
Psa49:2 Both low and high, rich and poor, together.
Psa49:3 My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.
Psa49:4 I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp.
Psa49:5 Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about?
Psa49:6 They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;
Psa49:7 None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him:
Psa49:8 (For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for ever:)
Psa49:9 That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption.
Psa49:10 For he seeth that wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.
Psa49:11 Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their own names.
Psa49:12 Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts that perish.
Psa49:13 This their way is their folly: yet their posterity approve their sayings. Selah.
Psa49:14 Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.
Psa49:15 But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me. Selah.
Psa49:16 Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased;
Psa49:17 For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him.
Psa49:18 Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and men will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself.
Psa49:19 He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light.
Psa49:20 Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish.
